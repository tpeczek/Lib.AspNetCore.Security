## Documentation

The documentation is available [here](https://tpeczek.github.io/Lib.AspNetCore.Security/).

There are also blog posts available describing key features of the library (some of them have been written in context of ASP.NET MVC or previous versions of this library but the core idea haven't changed):

- [Content Security Policy in ASP.NET Core MVC - TagHelper](https://www.tpeczek.com/2016/12/content-security-policy-in-aspnet-core.html)
- [Clearing site data upon sign out in ASP.NET Core](https://www.tpeczek.com/2018/02/clearing-site-data-upon-sign-out-in.html)

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/tpeczek) (either monthly or one-time).
